Syllable Network Preferences

(c) 2006 Andrew Kennan (akennan@westnet.com.au)

1) Installation

To build and install the application use:

	make
	make dist

2) Config files

The network preferences reads and modifies the following files:

	/etc/resolv.conf		- Nameservers and search domains.
	/etc/hostname			- System host name and domain.
	/etc/hosts				- Host definitions and aliases.
	/System/config/net.cfg	- Network interface configuration

The configuration stored in /boot/System/config/net.cfg is not compatible with the
previous version of the network preferences application.

3) Usage

Like the previous version, the network preferences application has two modes
of operation.

By supplying a --detect command line argument it will check for changes to 
the available network adapters. If a change is detected an alert will
instruct the user to log in as root and ensure the settings are correct and
the program will exit. If no changes are detected the program will exit.

When not detecting changes the application will display its normal window
allowing configuration of ethernet interfaces, host name and domain, known 
hosts and DNS servers.

If the user is not logged in as root, the UI will be read only.
