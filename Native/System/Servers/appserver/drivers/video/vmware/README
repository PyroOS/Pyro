This code is based on the XFree86 VMware driver written by VMware themselves.
The file "README.xfree86" is written by the VMware folks, and explains how the
interaction with the virtual machine takes place.  And actually it's just a
straight up copy of the file from the XFree86 sources.  This was the main source
of information that I drew upon.  Also a point of interest is that the XFree86
sources where licensed under the non-advertisment license, not the one
all those GPL kiddies are complaining about.

TODO
----
* Seperate out the class C++ code from the driver code, and put the driver in C
* Gylph acceleration
* Support older versions of VMware (?)

Enjoy!
