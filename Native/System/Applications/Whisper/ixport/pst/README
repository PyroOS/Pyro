This plugin is based on libPST 0.5.1, originally written by Dave Smith and maintained at
http://alioth.debian.org/projects/libpst by Joseph Nahmias.  The code has been slightly
modified to compile cleanly as C++ under Syllable.  The Whisper plugin (pst.h, pst.cpp)
is written by Kristian Van Der Vliet.

The plugin can read PST files created by Microsoft Outlook versions 97 to 2002.  Outlook
2003 PST files are not supported.  Outlook 2003 users should refer to the Microsoft Office
Assistance page at http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/assistance/HA011190371033.aspx,
which contains full instructions for exporting your Microsoft Outlook items in
Outlook 97-2002 PST format.

Currently only mail and sub-folders are imported.  Contacts and Journal entries are
ignored.  Rich Text and encrypted bodies within mail messages are ignored.  Attachments
may not be imported or imported incorrectly.
