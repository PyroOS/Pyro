	o Fix major bug with sigaction() in pop3_timer.c
	o Use calloc() instead of malloc() in pop3_create_session() to ensure strings are NUL terminated.
	o Improved error handling in pop3_get_message().
		o Don't leak memory.
	o Huge improvements to pop3_get_message() which can now handle badly behaved mail servers which consistently mis-report the size of the message.  Both "too small" and "too big" are now handled properly.
	o Added a size argument to pop3_get_message() which gives the size of the allocated buffer to the caller.
