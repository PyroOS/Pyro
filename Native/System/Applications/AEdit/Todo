* Be able to change name of file by clicking on the "tabheader". 
  Probably the TabView class must be rewritten to support this.
* Add recently opened files in the menu
* Direct access to a file using function keys 
  (ie. pressing F3 means select tab number 3, F6 tab number 6 etc.)
* Change Save All so it is actually saving all files (including those untitled)
