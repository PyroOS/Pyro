This file describes all changes made between versions of AEdit

2004-09-18 AEdit 1.6 Beta Jonas Jarvoll
===================================================================
First inoffical release of the Beta version

* Multiple files
* Save changes dialog
* Some code clean

2004-09-20 AEdit 1.6 Beta-2 Jonas Jarvoll
===================================================================
* Change name "Buffer" to "File" in statusbar
* When switching between files the cursor position is updated
* When starting the program without a filename a new file is 
  automatically created
* Stupid bug removed (pcTabView should be pcMyTabView)

2004-09-21 AEdit 1.6 Beta-2 Jonas Jarvoll
===================================================================
* Added shortcut for creating new file (Ctrl+N)
* Added menuitem and shortcut for moving through opened files (Ctrl+, and Ctr+.)
* Bug: The mouse pointer doesnt change to the correct image when pressing shortcut Ctrl+N

2004-09-24 AEdit 1.6 Beta-3 Jonas Jarvoll
===================================================================
* You can also use Ctrl+Tab or Shift+Ctrl+Tab to move through opened files.

2004-09-28 AEdit 1.6 Beta-3 Jonas Jarvoll
===================================================================
* First compile on Syllable 0.5.4
* Shortcut for closing buffer Ctrl+W
* New menuitem called "Save All". This item allows the user to save
  all modified files at once. Very nice to have when you have a lot
  of files opened and what to be sure that all are saved (like when you 
  program). Short cut has been set to Ctrl+B but can be discussed.
* With 0.5.4 I no longer can create FileRequesters. It will make a Abort
  core dumped. Thus seems to be something broken in 0.5.4? These have been 
  temporary commented out.
* When a menuitem is disabled also the shortcut plus belonging toolbar button
  is disabled.

2004-09-29 AEdit 1.6 Beta-3 Jonas Jarvoll
===================================================================
* FileRequester bug fixed. Turned out that you should pass "" instead
  of the getenv("$HOME") stuff.

2004-10-02 AEdit 1.6 Beta-3 Jonas Jarvoll
===================================================================
* Added visible shortcuts to the menuitems
* Cleaned up button_bar class (no need to keep track of number of buttons
  when you can have that information from the vector class itself
* Added small icons to the menuitems
* Replace previous icons with GTK stock items (in png format for easy change)
* Beta 3 released

2004-10-06 AEdit 1.6 Beta-4 Jonas Jarvoll
===================================================================
* Mixed Redo and Undo icon on the toolbar
* Changed so that only the filename is showed in the Tab label
  (this to avoid silly long tab name)

2004-10-09 AEdit 1.6 Beta-4 Jonas Jarvoll
===================================================================
* Due to the above changed to the tab label I forgot to add an asterix
  if the buffer has been modifed. This is now fixed.

2004-10-11 AEdit 1.6 Beta-4 Jonas Jarvoll
===================================================================
* You can now pass multiple filenames when starting AEdit and AEdit
  will open each in a new tab (eg. "aedit test1 test2 teste3")
  You can actually write "aedit *.cpp" and AEdit will open all your
  c-source files in the current directory.

2004-10-28 AEdit 1.6 Beta-4 Jonas Jarvoll
===================================================================
* For some strange reason Ctrl+B didnt work. I have changed it to
  Ctrl+L instead.
* Added support for DragAndDrop of files from the desktop

2004-11-09 AEdit 1.6 Jonas Jarvoll
===================================================================
* After some more testing I have decided to release the offical 
  1.6 version

2005-02-09 AEdit 1.7 Jonas Jarvoll

  is always focused in the text entry

  instead of inventing one by itself

  file requester bug.

2005-07-10 AEdit 2.0 Jonas Jarvoll
===================================================================

  implementing after how Whipser solved it I feel quite sure that 
  it is actually once and for all gone.
