To do before 1.0 release:
* fix 'skip all' when uploading directory
* complete error handling for recursive jobs
* recursive cancelling, pausing of recursive jobs
* have MainWindow peek at the paths of completed transfers and refresh the RemoteView if a relevant transfer finishes
* ignore duplicate transfers
* implement status bar messages
* provide way to remove finished transfers from progress window
* Add a label or other indication that the left pane is local, right pane is remote


Later:
* implement 'Retry' button on error dialogs for failed transfers
* Use 64-bit types for file size, offset etc (note: off_t is 64bit, size_t, ssize_t is only 32bit)
* use CURLOPT_USERNAME and CURLOPT_PASSWORD when available
* Use localised strings
* add doxygen comments for new code
* remove Job::m_nType in favour of an enum Job::m_eDirection (which is one of UPLOAD, DOWNLOAD or NONE) and a String Job::m_zType which is a human-readable name for the type of job (for debugging messages)
