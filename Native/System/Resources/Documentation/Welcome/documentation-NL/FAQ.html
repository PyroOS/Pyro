Syllable?</a> </div> The
goal of the Syllable project is to create a family of
easy-to-use open source operating systems, for the home and small
office
user. Syllable Desktop is an original desktop
operating system. Syllable Server is a matching small and efficient
Linux server. This FAQ is mostly about&nbsp;Syllable Desktop.<p>Syllable is currently under development, but it is stable and
relatively mature, with a number of useful applications already
available. Syllable supports a wide range of common hardware devices,
including video, network and sound cards from manufacturers such as
Intel, AMD, 3Com, nVidia and Creative. </p><div class="sub-chapter"> <a id="1_2">1.2 What is
the history of Syllable?</a> </div> <p> Syllable
was created in June 2002 as a fork of Kurt Skauen's AtheOS operating
system. AtheOS was started by Kurt in the early 90's, and was almost
entirely written from scratch by him. The first public release of
AtheOS, version 0.1.2, was released in 1997 and quickly gained a large
number of fans and interested users and developers. </p><p>
After the release of AtheOS 0.3.7 development slowed to a complete stop
as Kurt became interested in learning to fly his plane. Syllable was
forked by a small group of developers who had been involved with the
AtheOS community for some time. The first release of Syllable, version
0.4.0, was released in July 2002. Since then, we have made 22
releases over three major versions. </p><div class="sub-chapter"> <a id="1_3">1.3 Who is
behind Syllable?</a> </div> <p> There is a small
core team of developers, comprised of Kristian Van Der Vliet (Vanders),
Kaj de Vos and Anthony Morphett. There are also other developers who write patches,
create applications and port software for Syllable. </p><div class="sub-chapter"> <a id="1_4">1.4 How is
the team organised?</a> </div> <p> There is no
strong organisational structure, and people are free to work on
whatever interests them the most. Generally however Kristian
works on the kernel, device drivers, system libraries and servers. He
also&nbsp;maintains some specific systems and applications for Syllable. </p><p>
Kaj de Vos single-handedly writes and maintains Builder and also
maintains and tests its many package recipes, making him our official
build engineer. He is also the driving force behind the integration of
the REBOL-like ORCA scripting language into Syllable. </p>Anthony Morphett contributes various patches.<p>Dee Sharpe is working on 3D hardware acceleration through OpenGL. </p><div class="sub-chapter"> <a id="1_5">1.5 Is Syllable a BeOS clone?</a> </div>
<p> No. The goals of BeOS and Haiku are similar, and Syllable
does resemble BeOS in many respects, including its file system and the
basic structure and design of the application programming interfaces
(APIs), but it was never and will never be intended as a BeOS clone. </p><div class="sub-chapter"> <a id="1_6">1.6 How often
are new versions of Syllable released?</a> </div> <p>
We aim to provide stable releases of Syllable roughly every several months.
We also produce intermediate development builds of Syllable which can be
used to test bug fixes and new features but may be unstable for general
use. </p><div class="chapter"> 2. Installing
Syllable </div> <div class="sub-chapter"> <a id="2_1">2.1 What are the basic system requirements?</a>
</div> <p> Syllable requires at least a Pentium processor.
Installation requires several hundred megabytes on an LBA capable hard
disk. About
32MB of memory is needed to boot. You must have a supported video card
or a card with a VESA 2.0 BIOS. </p><p> A Pentium 60 with
32MB of ram and a 540MB hard disk or a small partition should be the minimum currently able
to 'run' Syllable. A Pentium 166MMX with 64MB of ram and a&nbsp;1GB partition can run Syllable quite comfortably. </p><div class="sub-chapter"> <a id="2_2">2.2 Will
Syllable work on my hardware?</a> </div> <p> As
long as your computer meets the basic hardware requirements in <a href="#2_1">section 2.1</a> then it is very likely
that Syllable will work. Syllable can also quite happily run on the
very latest motherboards with dual-core processors. Syllable currently
only runs on 32-bit Intel hardware (sometimes called "x86" or "IA32")
and can run on 64-bit (sometimes called "x86-64", "AMD64" or "EMT64")
hardware in 32-bit mode. </p><p> Syllable has drivers for
a wide range of common hardware.<br></p><div class="sub-chapter"><a id="2_3">2.3
Why does Syllable have its own version of GRUB?</a> </div>
<p> The problem is that the original author of AtheOS, Kurt, wrote
the AFS file system and the AFS module for GRUB. Because he wrote the
code, he retains the copyright to it. In order to place the AFS module
in the main GRUB source, the GRUB maintainers insist on a copyright
assignment to the FSF. Kurt did not want to do this, so never submitted
the AFS module to the GRUB maintainers. We cannot submit the module
either because we don't own the copyright on the code, so we cannot
assign it to the GRUB maintainers. </p><p> This issue may
be resolved soon because someone has re-written the AFS GRUB
module for  GRUB 2. </p><div class="sub-chapter"> <a id="2_4">2.4 Can I boot Syllable with the boot loader I
already installed?</a> </div> <p> Not directly. If
you are already using GRUB to boot your system, you could simply
re-install it using the version of GRUB that comes with Syllable, or
copy the Syllable AFS module (afs_stage_1_5) to your existing GRUB
installation. GRUB will then be capable of booting Syllable directly. </p><p>
Another option is to install GRUB for Syllable onto the partition you
have installed Syllable onto, and then "chain load" it from your
existing boot loader. How you do this will depend on the boot loader
you are using, and you should consult its documentation for more
information. </p><div class="sub-chapter"> <a id="2_5">2.5 Installing the boot loader (GRUB) failed. Why?</a>
</div> <p> Currently there are two known reasons why this
can happen: </p><ul> <li>The version of GRUB
currently available for Syllable can not install GRUB correctly on
large hard disks. In this case, you must install GRUB manually (see
section 3.1 of the installation instructions for more information).</li>
<li>The GRUB configuration file that was generated by the
Syllable installer is incorrect. This can happen on machines that have
Serial ATA (SATA) hard disks, in which case Syllable can incorrectly
identify the drive number that GRUB requires to boot. You may have to
edit the GRUB configuration file and change the GRUB drive identifiers,
then install GRUB manually (see section 3.1 of the installation
instructions for more information).</li> </ul> <p>
There are sometimes other problems related to GRUB, but these are
generally not Syllable specific issues. </p><div class="sub-chapter"> <a id="2_6">2.6 Where can
I find more information and help for GRUB?</a> </div> <p>
The official GRUB website can be found at <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/grub/">http://www.gnu.org/software/grub/</a>.
You should refer to the "GRUB Legacy" documentation located at <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/grub/manual/">http://www.gnu.org/software/grub/manual/</a>.<br></p><div class="sub-chapter"><a id="2_7">2.7
I tried to install Syllable and it doesn't work. What should I do?</a>
</div> <p> First, read this FAQ to see if your problem is
covered already. If it is not, please search our bug database at <a href="http://forum.syllable.org/viewforum.php?f=4">http://forum.syllable.org/viewforum.php?f=4</a> to see
if anyone else has
already reported a similar problem. If you can not find any reports of
your problem, please submit a new bug report. You may be asked to
download and try the latest weekly build or try various things to help
us to identify and solve your problem, so please bear that in mind. </p><p>
Please do not ignore the problem and hope it will be fixed in a future
release of Syllable. If we do not receive bug reports, we can not fix
the problem. </p><div class="chapter"> 3. Using
Syllable </div> <div class="sub-chapter"> <a id="3_1">3.1 The Welcome document</a> </div> <p>
Basic information on using Syllable is covered in the Welcome document,
available on-line at <a href="http://nl.syllable.org/Desktop/Welcome.html">http://nl.syllable.org/Desktop/Welcome.html</a>
or in Syllable at /Documentation/Welcome.html. </p><div class="sub-chapter"> <a id="3_2">3.2 Where can
I find software for Syllable?</a> </div> <p>Through
the main download page:&nbsp;<a href="http://nl.syllable.org/Syllable/downloads.html">http://nl.syllable.org/Syllable/downloads.html</a>.</p><p>A
corresponding site for Syllable Server is here:&nbsp;<a href="http://nl.syllable.org/Linux/downloads.html">http://nl.syllable.org/Linux/downloads.html</a>.<br></p><div class="sub-chapter"> <a id="3_3">3.3 What file
systems can Syllable use?</a> </div> <p> Syllable
can read and write AFS (its native file system) and FAT file systems.
It
can also read from CD-ROM ISO9660 (including RockRidge and Joliet
support), Linux ext2/3 and Windows NTFS. A BeFS driver is also included. </p><div class="chapter"> 4. Problem
solving </div> <div class="sub-chapter"> <a id="4_1">4.1 I think I've found a bug. What should I do?</a>
</div> <p> We are currently using the forum for bug
tracking:&nbsp;<a href="http://forum.syllable.org/viewforum.php?f=4">http://forum.syllable.org/viewforum.php?f=4</a>
(a new bug tracker will be implemented later).
Please search it first to see if the bug has already been reported. If
you think you have found a new bug, please create a new bug report. You
should include basic information about the bug, and if it is related to
hardware or a certain device, information about the hardware
configuration. </p><div class="sub-chapter"> <a id="4_2">4.2 How do I add or change the kernel boot options?</a>
</div> <p> You can add a temporary option by editing the
GRUB configuration at boot, or you can add a permanent option by
editing the GRUB configuration file within Syllable. </p><p>
To add a temporary boot option: </p><p> When the boot
loader (GRUB) starts it will display a menu of available systems. At
this menu, select the Syllable entry and press the "e" key. This will
display the GRUB configuration. Using the arrow keys, select the line
that begins with "kernel" and press "e" again to edit this line. At the
end of the line, add the options you require. Once you are done, press
"ENTER" to accept the changes, then press "b" to boot with the modified
GRUB configuration. Changes made this way will not be permanent. </p><p>
To add a permanent boot option: </p><p> The GRUB
configuration file can be found in /boot/boot/grub/menu.lst. Open it
with your preferred text editor (usually aedit) and add the options you require to the
end of the line that begins with "kernel". Once you are done, save the
file. The next time you boot Syllable, the new kernel options will be
used. </p><div class="sub-chapter"> <a id="4_3">4.3
How can I capture the kernel log?</a> </div> <p>
Normally Syllable logs the kernel debug output to the file
/var/log/kernel. If for some reason you can not retrieve this file (for
example Syllable fails to boot properly), you can also capture the
debug
output using a "null-modem" cable connected to a second computer. </p><p>
Once you have connected both machines together with the cable, you
should run a serial terminal application such as Minicom on Linux or
HyperTerm on Windows. The software must be configured for a baudrate of
19200bps, 8 data bits, no parity and 1 stop bit (commonly abreviated as
"8N1"). </p><p> When you boot Syllable on the first
machine, follow section 4.2 to add the following kernel boot
parameters: </p><div class="terminal"> debug_port=1 debug_baudrate=19200 debug_plaintext=true<br></div>
<p> You
should use "debug_port=2" if the null-modem cable is connected to the
second serial port instead. When Syllable boots the kernel debug output
will be sent to the other machine, where you can use the terminal
software to capture the data to a file. </p><div class="chapter"> 5. Virtual machines and emulators </div>
<div class="sub-chapter"> <a id="5_1">5.1
Can I use Syllable with VMware?</a> </div> Yes.
An official VMware disk image is available from the system
downloads for Syllable at&nbsp;<a href="../pages/get-Syllable.html#emulate">../pages/get-Syllable.html#emulate</a>.<p>Reportedly,
Syllable hangs on VMware Workstation when running on dual-core AMD
processors. If you run into this, you can fix it by adding the line</p><div class="terminal"> host.TSC.noForceSync = "TRUE"<br></div>
<p>to the config.ini file in the VMware Workstation application data folder. On Windows Vista, this is in</p><p>C:\Users\All Users\VMware\VMware Workstation\config.ini</p><p>(Note that the All Users folder is hidden by default.)<br></p><div class="sub-chapter"><a id="5_2">5.2
Can I use Syllable with Virtual PC?</a> </div> <p>
Syllable is known to work on Virtual PC from version 5.1 onwards. On
Virtual PC
2007 you must add the following kernel parameters (see section 4.2). </p><div class="terminal"> disable_smp=true disable_pci_irq_routing=true<br></div>
<div class="sub-chapter"><a id="5_3">5.3
Can I use Syllable with Parallels?</a>
</div> <p> There have been reports of both success and
failure of using Syllable with Parallels, so the situation is unclear.
The latest report was that Syllable did work. Your best bet may be to
try it, and then let us know how you got on! </p><div class="sub-chapter"> <a id="5_4">5.4 Can I use
Syllable with Qemu?</a> </div> <p>
Yes. Syllable is
known to work with Qemu as long as you are using a VESA 2.0 VGA BIOS
(which is included in the latest Qemu versions). It is best to run Qemu
with the -std-vga&nbsp;parameter, because the default Cirrus Logic
video emulation is actually slower with Syllable and
limits the available screen modes. The colour palette is still limited.
Strangely, current Syllable versions run slightly slower with
virtualisation instead of faster, so if you are running on Linux and
you have the KQemu accelerator kernel module loaded, it should better
be turned off with the -no-kqemu parameter.</p><p>You can
use the Syllable live CD, as an ISO image or mounted physically, or the
.vmdk file from the VMware disk image. </p><div class="sub-chapter"> <a id="5_5">5.5 Can I use
Syllable with VirtualBox?</a> </div> <p> Yes. Since
version 0.6.4 Syllable runs on VirtualBox. However, the performance is
poor and there is no accelerated video support. You may also need to
use the following kernel parameter (see section 4.2). </p><div class="terminal"> disable_smp=true </div> <div class="chapter"> 6. Other </div> <div class="sub-chapter"> <a id="6_1">6.1 I have
some suggestions. Who can I talk to?</a> </div> <p>
