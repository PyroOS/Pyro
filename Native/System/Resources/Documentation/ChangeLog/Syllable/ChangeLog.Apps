Patches from Anthony Morphett

o Fix bug http://forum.syllable-norden.info/viewtopic.php?t=926: AEdit doesn't
  show the last character of file if it's not a newline. The patch also
  changes the file saving behaviour so that it doesn't add \n to the end of
  the last line of the file.

* March 25, 2008, Kaj de Vos *

Merged Arno's versions of sIDE, LayoutEditor and Sourcery from the sIDE 0.4.7-2 package.
Made some fixes and updates along the way.

*** All developers are required to merge their work with the repository, or else! ***

Fixed LibCodeView and Sourcery makefiles.

Applied a fix to LibCodeView for keyboard shortcuts while Caps-Lock is on from "kasbah".

* March 20, 2008, Kaj de Vos *

Updated old build settings in sIDE to conform to modern standards.

* March 20, 2008, Rick Caudill *

Imported LogMonitor (formerly ATail) into developer apps.

preferences applet, and updated the makefiles.

Added a Settings Editor (originally called ASE by Henrik).

* September 26, 2007, Rick Caudill *

Camera now includes support for 'Print Screen' key

I have also added a boolean value to Clipper so it will not invoke the event on startup of 
the Dock(this is a quick hack).

* September 18, 2007, Rick Caudill *

Changed how Clipper works.  Now Clipper waits for an event from the appserver telling
it that there has been new data added to it.  Clipper also got an overhaul on how clips
are managed.  Now clips are managed by date, so a user can know what they copied and when
they copied it.  Dates are in YYYY-MM-DD format.  

An example of the menu structure is:
	2007-9-18
		-> Clip 1
		-> Clip 2
		-> Clip 3
		...
		-> Clip n
	2007-9-19
		-> Clip 1
	2007-9-20
		-> Clip 1
		-> Clip 2
	....
	2008-9-18
		-> Clip 1
		-> Clip 2
	...

forward-delete work correctly with the default Bash keybindings.

* March 17, 2007, Kristian Van Der Vliet *

if the user makes changes elsewhere in the dialog. Patch from Athony Morphett <awmorp@gmail.com>
