Boot Options

You can add a temporary option by editing the GRUB configuration at boot, or you
can add a permanent option by editing the GRUB configuration file within Pyro.

To add a temporary boot option:
When the boot loader (GRUB) starts it will display a menu of available systems.
At this menu, select the Pyro entry and press the "e" key. This will display the
GRUB configuration. Using the arrow keys, select the line that begins with "kernel"
and press "e" again to edit this line. At the end of the line, add the options you
require. Once you are done, press "ENTER" to accept the changes, then press "b" to
boot with the modified GRUB configuration. Changes made this way will not be permanent.

To add a permanent boot option:
The GRUB configuration file can be found in /boot/boot/grub/menu.lst. Open it with
your preferred text editor (usually aedit) and add the options you require to the
end of the line that begins with "kernel". Once you are done, save the file. The
next time you boot Pyro, the new kernel options will be used.
