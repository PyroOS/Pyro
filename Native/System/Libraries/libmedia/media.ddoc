Here you will find documentation of the various C++ classes involved
in the Media API

The Media API can be used to play or record audio and video content 
aswell as converting media data from one format to the other. It contains 
a lowlevel api that is especially important if you want to write drivers for
the media system. Otherwise you can use the highlevel api (media stage objects) 
in most cases. To do anything with the media system you need to create a MediaManager 
object using MediaManager::Get() and keep it as long as you need to use any object of
the media system. Call MediaManager::Put() when you have finished.
