The sindent.sh script uses GNU Indent and sed to format a C or C++
file using the standard Syllable indentation and formating. You must
also have GNU Indent installed to use this script.

To use it, simply pass the name of the file you wish to indent, E.g.

$ sindent.sh window.cpp

Please check that your code compiles *after* you have run the sindent
script! While GNU Indent should not prove destructive, you can never
be too careful.

The latest rules concerning the Syllable code style can be found on the
Syllable Wiki http://www.syllable-wiki.tk or directly via the address
