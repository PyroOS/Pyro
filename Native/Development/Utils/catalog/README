catalogtool
===========

Simple tool used to manipulate .catalog files. With it, you can:

* List the contents of a catalog, eg:

	catalogtool --list catcomp.catalog

* Add or change a string in a catalog:

	catalogtool --set catcomp.catalog 5000 Hello!

	(This will set string 5000 in catcomp.catalog to "Hello!")

	If the file doesn't exist, a new catalog file is created.

* Get a string from a catalog:

	catalogtool --get catcomp.catalog 5000

	(This will print out string 5000. Could perhaps be used to localise scripts).

catcomp
=======

The catalog compiler. Compiles catalog description (.cd) files to binary .catalog
files. It will also create a header file that you should include in your projects
to be able to use the translated strings.

	catcomp -c catcomp.cd

Creates two files, catcomp.catalog and catcomp.h.

	catcomp -t catcomp.cd

Creates one file, catcomp.catalog.

The .cd files should contain ID-string mappings of the form:

NAME[=ID]	STRING

The file can also contain C++ style comments. '\n' is converted to a line feed
character (LF).

Here's an example:
