Hex Editor
==========

This is a simple binary file editor for Syllable. It supports hexadecimal and ASCII 
editing.


Building and Installing
-----------------------

This is just a matter of running make and then copying the HexEditor binary to wherever
 you want it.


Using Hex Editor
----------------

This should be pretty straight forward. Most normal text editor controls should work. 
About the only unusual thing is being able to change the selected column with ALT-1 for
hex and ALT-2 for ASCII.

Future Plans
------------

* Column types for binary and octal.
* Make it configurable:
  * Colours and fonts.
  * Shortcut keys.
  * Layout of columns.
* Maybe put something in the Help menu...
* Replace the icon :]
