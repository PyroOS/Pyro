Glibc Pyro Changelog

* September 27 2008 *

	o clock_gettime.c, clock_getres.c: New files. Support CLOCK_MONOTONIC & CLOCK_REALTIME
	o getmntent.c, setmntent.c: New files.

* July 12 2008, Anthony Morphett *

	o get_system_info_v.c: New file, provides proper handling of get_system_info syscall versions.
	o get_system_info.c: Assumes SYS_INFO_VERSION == 3 for compatibility with old binaries.
	o sys/sysinfo.h: Added get_system_info_v(); added macro get_system_info() wrapping
	  get_system_info_v() with the current SYS_INFO_VERSION.

* April 5th 2008 *

	o get_system_info.c: Call get_system_info directly.
	o xget_system_info.c: Removed.

* March 16th 2008 *

	o socketpair.c: New file. Taken from an older libiberty implementation.

* January 27th 2008 *

	o aio_cancel.c, aio_read64.c, aio_read.c, aio_write64.c, aio_write.c: New files. Emulate
	  basic async IO using pread() & pwrite()

* January 24th 2008 *

	o Makeconfig: Over-ride built-program-cmd
	o configure: Un-merged the *-*-syllable* handling patches to..
	o syllable/configure: Here. New file.
	o shlib-versions: Un-merged the *-*-syllable* definitions to..
	o syllable/shlib-versions: Here. New file.
	o timezone/zic.c: Use symlink() instead of link()
	o timezone/Makefile: Removed the old patches. We now process and install the zoneinfo data.

* January 15th 2008 *

	o Makeconfig: Over-ride the run-program-prefix variable so we don't try to invoke generated
	  programs with our non-existent ld.so

* December 26th 2007 *

	o tld.c: TLD destructors are now handled in a POSIX compliant manner.

* December 23rd 2007 *

	o tld.c: Fix/implement TLD destructors. The destructor list is maintained correctly on a
	  per-thread basis. If a destructor is registered for a given TLD it will now be called
	  during free_tld() and passed the last value of the TLD.
	o tld.c: Implemented __free_all_tlds(). All TLDs allocated to the calling thread will
	  be freed and and TLD destructors will be called.
	o exit_thread.c: New file. Call __free_all_tlds() before the exit_thread syscall.
	o syscalls.list: Remove exit_thread

* December 6th 2007 *

	o net/route.h: Removed. It conflicts with the system header.

* November 23rd 2007 *

	o bits/time.h: Include <posix/time.h> for the definition of CLOCKS_PER_SEC, don't redefine
	  it here.
	o bits/libc-lock.h: Provide __libc_lock_read() to get the scaler value of the lock. Required
	  for code that treats a __libc_once type as scaler I.e. sysdeps/posix/getaddrinfo.c
	o open_attrdir.c, open_indexdir.c, fopendir.c: Update to reflect the changes to the data member
	  in struct __dirstream
	o i386/sysdep.h: Define the macros PTR_MANGLE & PTR_DEMANGLE
	o i386/sysdep-cancel.h: New file. Define NO_CANCELLATION
	o sched_cpualloc.c: New file. Empty to stop posix/sched_cpualloc.c being build, which appears
	  to be Linux specific?

* November 22nd 2007 *

	o kernel-features.h: New file. Define some macros that are used elsewhere to select
	  functionality.

* March 27th 2007 *

	o settimeofday.c: New file. A replacement of the standard unix/sysv implementation. This
	  implementation allows high-resolution microsecond accuracy.
	o adjtime.c: New file.

* March 12th 2007 *

	o getrusage.c: Fixed a possible division by 0.

* Febuary 23rd 2007 *

	o readdir64.c: New file. Replaces stub for dirent/readdir64.c.

* Febuary 8th 2007 *

	o getrusage.c: New file. Simple stub, only useful for RUSAGE_SELF.
	o set_real_time.c: New file. The 64bit syscall argument is passed as two 32bit high/low parts. 

* May 26th 2006 *

	o Add-on configure & configure.in  are no longer required.

* May 25th 2006 *

	o Removed some non-Syllable syscalls from syscalls.list
		o sysinfo
		o swapon
		o swapoff
		o mknod

* January 6th 2006 *

	o pwrite.c: New file.  Simple wrapper around write_pos()
	o pwrite64.c: Likewise.
	o pread.c: New file.  Simple wrapper around read_pos()
	o pread64.c: Likewise.
	o syscalls.list/event(): New syscall.
	o param.h: Define BSD names for some stuff in limits.h

* January 5th 2006 *

	o getrlimit.c/getrlimit(): Fix call to get_thread_info() for RLIMIT_STACK

* January 4th 2006 *

	o backtrace.c: New file.  A version of backtrace() that does not require DWARF2 support from libgcc.
	  From Jan Hauffa.
	o getdomain.c: New file.  The implementation is based on getdomainname.c by Joerg Schilling
	o Makefile/$(objpfx)syscall-%.h $(objpfx)syscall-%.d: Use the add-on location of syscall.h

* January 3rd 2006 *

	o libc-start.c/__libc_start_main(): Don't pre-allocate TLDs.
	o spawn_thread.c/__thread_start(): Likewise.
	o bits/libc-tsd.h: Use the TLD range 512-1024 for Glibc TSD slots.
	o termio.h: New file.

* January 1st 2006 *

	o tld.c/get_tld_addr(): Calculate the TLD addr without making a syscall.  We get the thread data address
	  from TLD_BASE, which is provided by the kernel.

* December 23rd 2005 *

	o getrlimit.c: New file.  A stub using placeholder values (That are at least semi-sensible) until we
	  have proper getrlimit/setrlimit syscalls.

* December 21st 2005 *

	o Cleaned up patches ready for Builder/mainline.  Don't patch elf/dl-support.c, sydeps/posix/pwrite64.c
	  or malloc/arena.
	o Merged Changes.2 & Changes.1 into one file (Changes.1)
	o sysdeps/unix/sysv/syllable/TODO: Removed
	o TODO: New file
	o README: New file
	o nice.c: New file.  Use generic UNIX version of nice()
	o getpriority.c, setpriority.c: New files
	o fsync.c: Implemented.  If fsync() fails, it performs a full sync() instead.

* December 20th 2005 *

	o Move Changes files to root of add-ons directory
	o Sync to Glibc CVS
	o ABI tag # changed from 4 to 5 to avoid conflict with kFreeBSD
	o libc-start.c: Move check_one_fd() & check_standard_fds() to..
	o check_fds.c: ..here.  New file.
	o init-first.c: Use new location of enbl-secure.c
	o glob64.c: Use new location of glob.c
	o vfork.c: Use new location of generic vfork.c
	o brk.c: Use new location of generic brk.c
	o backtracesymc.c, backtracesymsfd.c: Use new location of generic backtracesyms.c & backtracesymsfd.c
	o elf-init.c: New file.  Provide a sparse version that doesn't require init_array/fini_array support.
	o Removed syslog.c & syslog.h from sysdeps/generic/; we can just override the ones in misc/

* December 19th 2005 *

	o Renamed Changes.2-3-3 to Changes.1 and started new Changes file
	o Begin split of Syllable code into an add-on ports package by moving code from sysdeps/unix/sysv/syllable
	  to syllable/sysdeps/unix/sysv/syllable
	o Added Makeconfig, configure & configure.in to add-on root directory from Glibc ports CVS
	o Added a dummy Makefile to add-on root directory with empty targets for subdir_lib, lib, other & install, and
	  create empty stamp files.
	o getdents64.c: Don't use an absolute path to include getdents.c
	o i386/sigreturn.S: Have our own version instead of patching the generic version
	o i386/syllable-start.S: Move to add-on sysdeps/i386/elf directory & rename to start.S, which neatly overides
	  the standard ELF32 version.
	o Makefile: Remove special rules for syllable-start.S
