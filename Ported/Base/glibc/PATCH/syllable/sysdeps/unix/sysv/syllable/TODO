o libc_pic.a currently has a bunch of symbols imported from init-first.c which arn't needed.  We
  also have a clash for _init, which is defined in init-first.c normally but also gets into
  libc_pic.a via. crti.S  We need to work out which of these is correct and fix libc_pic.a so that
  it doesn't clash.  This is one bug which is currently stopping us from being able to build elf/sln.
o Add a R/W lock implementation to bits/libc-lock.h
o malloc/arena.c uses ptmalloc_lock_all, ptmalloc_unlock_all with the macro thread_atfork (Which
  wraps __register_atfork)  At the moment we #define __register_atfork in libc-lock.h as an empty
  macro.  This is the wrong place for the macro, and this also produces warning about
  ptmalloc_lock_all & ptmalloc_unlock_all being defined but not used. See below.
o Create a proper __register_atfork() implementation.  Keep three lists of functions; each function
  in the "prepare" list is called just before INLINE_SYSCALL(fork), each function in the "child"
  list is called after for the child & each function in the "parent" list is called for the parent.
  Functions in the list are called from the tail of the list to the head E.g. in reverse order.
  We'll also probably need an __unregister_atfork().
o tld.c; free_tld() should be calling the destructor function before we free the destructor node.
  Need to test the current functionality in Pyro first though.
o Fix configure.in?

--Almost Done--

o Make changes to /elf files to not build rtld, libdl.so & ld.so for Pyro -:- Done but hacked up.
o Complete i386/libc_lock.c (__libc_lock_atfork() is not implemented & the declaration has been
  removed from libc_lock.h)
